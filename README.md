# Genetic Feature Detection on Breast Cancer Subtypes

This project uses supervised deep learning to classify six breast cancer subtypes based on gene expression data from the GSE45827 dataset. Built using PyTorch, the model achieves **90%+ accuracy** and identifies the most influential genes associated with each subtype using a two-layer neural network.
